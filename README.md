# Deep-Learning-Project-Instance-Segmentation

In my final project in Deep Learning course I wrote an instance segmentation model on the "The Oxford-IIIT Pet" Dataset.

Model steps:

* Loading data from Tensor Flow Datasets
* Image resizing and normalization
* Building pipeline
* Transfer Learning of the "MobilNet" network for the base (down sampling) model
* upSampling FC model definition
* Model compilation and training (with visualization)
